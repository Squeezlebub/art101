					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Use jQuery to add a button to the website that outputs a short random string of text.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My partner and I completed this lab in section this morning with very little issue or problems. I had to make sure to add certain pieces of code inside the listener callback to make sure they work, but that was very quickly resolved, even with completing the Task X Bonus.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I can definitely feel myself improving with jQuery between these labs, as they help me really cleanly see my improvement in real time. We also completed the Task X Bonus by trying to reverse engineer the complex CSS on Wes' page. We ultimatey changed some parts of it (like removing paragraph tags in a few places and changing max width and border styles). Overall, I'm quite happy with how this lab went. </p>
