			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create an array and an object using javascript.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The largest problem was printing the object with the listed function properly on the webpage, as the method given in the lab instructions for accomplishing this prints the object with strange indentation as well as additional brackets that don't need to be there. I tried MANY different methods but given that we had not even learned how functions work or how to print objects I was unable to succeed based purely on what I could learn from the internet.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was extremely simple, save for outputting the function within the object we were told to create. In spite of not learning how to use functions yet or how to output them, I searched the internet and tried many different methods to get it displaying correctly, but did not manage. I think I put a lot of effort into this lab, even if it was ultimately unsuccessful in finding a workaround for the code we were given not displaying correctly. </p>
