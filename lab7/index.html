			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a function that accepts the user's name and sorts it, then outputs it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> In terms of problems, they were particularly in terms of prompting the user for their name. Initially we had it set up in such a way that was causing it to prompt the user for their name two seperate times, but that was a result of the HTML file referencing the javascript twice, once in the main body and another in the heading. So that was easily changed. It also appears before the website has fully loaded, but we were unable to find a way to change this from happening (until now that we came back and Debugged for Lab 14). 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall this lab was a nice foray into doing some more hands-on coding and working with functions. We encountered some minor problems as we went, but ultimately the lab was a success and I feel like my knowledge of javascript improved. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Debugging</h2>
					<p> For this lab, we had a problem where the prompt was appearing before the website itself had loaded. We initially tried to debug and fix this without using Jquery, as our original lab didn't use it. However we were not able to find a very elegant solution this way, and we ended up opting for using Jquery, which allowed us to achieve our desired result. </p>
