					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a function that accepts the user's name and sorts it, then outputs it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> In terms of problems, they were particularly in terms of prompting the user for their name. Initially we had it set up in such a way that was causing it to prompt the user for their name two seperate times, but that was a result of the HTML file referencing the javascript twice, once in the main body and another in the heading. So that was easily changed. It also appears before the website has fully loaded, but we were unable to find a way to change this from happening.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall this lab was a nice foray into doing some more hands-on coding and working with functions. We encountered some minor problems as we went, but ultimately the lab was a success and I feel like my knowledge of javascript improved. </p>
