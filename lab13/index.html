			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge was to create a function that loops through 1-200 and replaces certain numbers with phrases based on what they divide by. 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I had some errors that I had a hard time fixing but seemed to disappear when I added a button that triggered the loop code to run. I'm still truly unsure what some of those errors were, but I'm glad to have had my partners help debugging to get it working by the end. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a fairly complex lab, but it was helped by the fact that we essentially went over exactly what needed to be done to complete it at the end of the last lecture. Even so, this lab definitely forced me to dig deep on my javascript knowledge and was a rewarding experience.  </p>
