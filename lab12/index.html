					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab is to use conditionals to create a program which sorts users into one of our different groups based on a provided name. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> My partner and I did not have very many difficulties in completing this lab. I made the newbie mistake of not adding everything into the callback that needed to be there but that was quickly resolved. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a more complex lab comparatively to some of the last few. In spite of this, we completed the vast majority of the coding in section, and I think it really helped me get a better sense of conditionals and how they can be applied in combination with the other elements we have been learning over the course of the... course.  </p>
