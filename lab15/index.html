			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challenge of this lab was to integrate an API into our webpage with AJAX.
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We honestly did not have any problems. My first attempt worked great and is continuing to work great. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This was a nice and simple lab, I think largely in part to how much we went over in class and in section. That helped me feel very prepared for this lab and made it go quite smoothly overall.  </p>
