					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> Use jQuery to add buttons to the website which triggers a change in CSS of particular sections when clicked. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> I was really surprised and how quickly and efficiently my partner and I finished this lab, including completing the bonus task. The only problem we encountered was using an ID to change the section CSS instead of a class, which was preventing it from being called multiple times, but this was quickly resolved.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This lab was a really nice and simple introduction to jQuery. I was really pleasantly surprised by how well I understood it and how we were able to complete the whole assignment with so little javascript. And I'm proud of us for also completing the Bonus Task in addition. </p>
