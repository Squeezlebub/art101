			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create an array of numbers, then create using anonymous and calbback functions, apply a mathematical operation to each element of that array and return it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> There really were not any problems with this lab. I was pleasantly surprised at how well I grasped the material and how quickly my partner and I were able to reach the correct solution. I think it went very, very smoothly. 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I think this was a nice lab to ease us into the idea of anonymous functions and callbacks. My partner and I also completed the majority of the lab in our Section early this morning so it felt great to be proactive about it and get it done in a timely fashion when we were in person.   </p>
