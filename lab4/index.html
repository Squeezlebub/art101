			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Code</h2>
				<pre><code>// Pseudocode for Rock-Paper-Scissors:
//Create a field for player 1 input
    //Accept user input, “rock”, “paper”, or “scissors”
//Generate computer choice
//Evaluate who wins 
    //Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper
//Display who wins
// Ask if the player wants to play again, and repeat from step 1 if yes.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Practice pseudocoding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Getting our code to show on the website with normal indentation took us a bit of time to figure out, but it was otherwise fairly smooth sailing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The lab went well, the pseudocoding was fun and interesting to think about but broadly not too difficult. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<ol> How to Reseat RAM in a PC:
					<li> Fully power off the system.</li>
					<li> Turn the power switch off (if necessary), and unplug the power cable from the wall.</li>
					<li> Lay the computer flat on the ground. </li>
					<li> Open/remove the side panel. May require a screwdriver.</li>
					<li> Locate the RAM sticks.</li>
					<li> Push the 2 tabs on the top and bottom of the RAM sockets away from each other.</li>
					<li> Take the stick out, noting which socket it came from.</li>
					<li> Blow on it lightly for good luck, and pray to RNGesus.</li>
					<li> Repeat for each stick in your system.</li>
					<li> Insert each ram stick back into the system in the same socket they were in before, making sure to push down and hear an audible click on each of the two tabs.</li>
					<li> Put the panel back on, screwing it back in if necessary.</li>
					<li> Put the computer upright.</li>
					<li> Plug the power cable back in and turn the power switch on if necessary.</li>
					<li> Turn the computer back on, success! (hopefully)</li>
